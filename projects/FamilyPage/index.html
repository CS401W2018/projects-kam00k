						<h3>Mum</h3>
						<p>Mum is my Mum. She's from the region of England known simply as "THE NORTH". She speaks intelligble English unless
						she is with her siblings, in which case Americans (like my dad) often require subtitles. She currently works as a
						SQL and Excel wizard.</p>

						<h3>Younger Brother</h3>
						<p>Younger Brother has almost finished his undergrad at Utah State and has recently attained his CFA Level 1. 
						He is an avid player of tabletop RPGs and MtG. He gives me a lot of crap for watching anime even though
						he watches more anime than I do. Younger Brother has an affinity for Ken from Barbie, because Younger Brother
						has an affinity for Ryan Gosling.</p>
