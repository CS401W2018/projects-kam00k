	<h2>Internet 	</h2>
	<p>A system of infrastructure and protocols used to connect local area networks together, regardless of distance. 	</p>
	<h2>Web 	</h2>
	<p>A system designed to make the advantages and uses of the internet more easily accessible to people outside of the IT and enthusiast sphere. 	</p>
	<h2>How are the Internet and Web different?	</h2>
	<p>The Internet is the physical infrastructure the Web runs on. The web is just information and software. 	</p>
	<h2>ASCII and Unicode	</h2>
	<p>ASCII is a standard for encoding text, digits, symbols, etc. Unicode allows for a much broader set of characters than ASCII, allowing for characters from other languages. 	</p>
	<h2>What is UTF-8	</h2>
	<p>A character encoding standard that uses one to four single-byte code units. It is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII	</p>
	<h2>URL	</h2>
	<p>Uniform Resource Locator – the address of a specific resource on the internet. 	</p>
	<h2>Domain Name	</h2>
	<p>A string of text that is mapped to an IP address, usually by a DNS server, and used to access websites. It is used in favor of pure IP addresses to be more memorable and legible to humans. 	</p>
	<h2>HTTP	</h2>
	<p>The primary protocol for transmitting information on the internet. It allows for documents that link directly to other documents through hyperlinks. 	</p>
	<h2>HTTPS	</h2>
	<p>A secure implementation of HTTP that uses TLS for encrypting internet traffic. 	</p>
	<h2>IP Address	</h2>
	<p>(Ideally) an address that identifies a single computer. IPv4 doesn't have a large enough address space to do this anymore, but a combination of private IP ranges and NATs mitigate the problems associated with insufficient IP addresses. They've been promising to move us to IPv6 for 30 years now and we're still waiting...</p>
	<h2>DNS	</h2>
	<p>Domain Name Service – A service by which domain names (website addresses) are mapped to IP addresses. </p>
	<h2>W3C Recommendations	</h2>
	<p>Standards published by the W3C that are considered best practices for web application development. 	</p>
	<h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5	</h2>
	<p>The names of various markup languages used on the Web. XML is primarily used for transferring data (such as in API calls), while HTML is primarily used for rendering user interfaces and web pages. The rule of thumb is that XML stores data, while HTML displays it. 	</p>
