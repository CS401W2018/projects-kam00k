			<h2>Buckin' Billy Ray Smith</h2>
			<p>
				Billy Ray Smith is a Youtuber from Vancouver Island who runs a business chiefly aimed at cutting down trees that pose a hazard. 
				A gigantic, top-heavy man with a mild manner of speech and a Canadian accent so thick that he sounds Irish, Billy is a walking stereotype
				of a Canadian logger. His videos are done at a very slow, relaxing pace. He's not in a rush to teach you his wisdom, as you the viewer should
				not be in such a rush to learn it. Learning what he knows takes time and practice to do safely, but he makes the experience friendly and accessible.
				
				Billy does videos on the following topics, among others:
				
			</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Power saws</dt>
				<dd>Billy will often show antique saws in his collection, among which are several gigantic 125cc McCullough saws. He goes over their history, their features, their quirks, etc.</dd>
				
				<dt>Chain sharpening</dt>
				<dd>Among Billy's most insightful videos are the ones on how to sharpen the blades on power saw chains. A seasoned master in his field, he demonstrates that you don't need file guides or electric grinders to do the job quick and right.</dd>
				
				<dt>Axes & Wood Splitting</dt>
				<dd>Billy loves his axes, and expresses his admiration for the craftsmanship involved in making different types of splitting axe heads. There's a lot more nuance to them than you might think!</dd>
				
				<dt>Tree felling</dt>
				<dd>In some videos, Billy takes us with him to walk us through the process of determining how a tree should be cut, where it needs to land and how to get it there without destroying anything. His technique in felling 5-foot-thick behemoths is a sight to behold.</dd>
