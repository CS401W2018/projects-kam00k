			<h2>Felling</h2>
			<p>One of my favorite hobbies is cutting down trees. "Lumberjack" is among my many nicknames. <br>
			It is one of my few hobbies at which I have actually had success.</p>
			
			<p>
			I've met a few people in the past who think they can just go out with a chainsaw and cut down a tree. <br>
			I have also seen several quite unnerving examples of trees that have been cut down by people who should have known better.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Felling trees is extremely dangerous, and doing it properly is a skill. Cutting a tree improperly can very easily kill you, others or destroy property. Do NOT attempt it unless you actually know what you're doing.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The general process of cutting a tree down is as follows:
			</p>
			
				<ol>
					<li>Fall direction of the tree is determined. Options are limited without specialized equipment if the tree is leaning more than a few degrees.</li>
					<li>A notch cut is made, also known as an undercut. This faces the intended fall direction. Angles and depths for these cuts vary, but they are generally between 1/5 and 1/3 of the thickness of the tree</li>
					<li>Once the notch cut has been made, a back cut is made on the other side of the trunk, a little above the corner of the notch cut.
					Techniques for this cut depend on the size and lean of the tree. 
					The feller may insert wedges as he makes the back cut, especially if the tree is leaning opposite its intended fall direction. 
					The feller will not cut all the way through the tree when making the back cut—
					The goal is to create a hinge between the undercut and the back cut which will direct the fall of the tree.</li>
					<li>If the tree is already leaning in its intended direction, it will slowly start to fall. The feller will observe the direction it is falling and then quickly move away from the tree at a 45° angle from the direction opposite its fall.
					By this the feller avoids potential kickback from the tree, which can easily be fatal. </li>
					<li>Assuming the tree has not caught on a neighboring tree while falling, the feller can now proceed to cut it up to be hauled away for further processing. 
				</ol>

				There is a lot more to felling trees than the above. Power saws need <i>very</i> regular maintenance - Sharpening blades, bar and chain oil, air filter cleaning, carb cleaning, etc.
