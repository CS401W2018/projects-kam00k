			<p><br>Solar is a huge part of the renewables industry. Arguably the most reliable renewable source of energy, many solar modules are rated and warranted
			for twenty-five to thirty years. Their total usable lifespan is often expected to be fifty years or more. Once a module is at End Of Life, 
			the majority of its components are fully recyclable (glass, silicon, aluminium, silver, etc). In this way it is considerably more "green" than, say, wind turbines
			(ask wind turbine manufacturers where the blades go when they're decomissioned...), but there's just one caveat: The sun sets. </p>
			
			<p>
			<br>In fact, how many people actually know how solar even works? I have met customers who have been under the impression that their nice shiny new solar array
			will allow them to detach themselves from the nasty, polluting electricity they buy from their utility company (It does not do this), or that it means they can buy
			a Tesla and not have to worry about a large bill (it probably won't do this either). Solar also only makes sense as an long-term investment for homeowners and businesses because of
			heavy subsidies and government-imposed incentives. That also assumes nothing goes wrong - Despite the reliability of the modules themselves, other components like 
			inverters, optimizers and RSDs fail all the time. Sometimes the customer is not aware of failures for years, and sometimes by the time they do notice, the small business they contracted
			to build the array has gone out of business, rendering their workmanship warranty void. This is why there's more to solar than what the sales folk tell you. I can help you navigate
			this minefield of an industry, and find out if it really is something that makes sense for you to do.
