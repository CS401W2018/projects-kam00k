					<p>
						Solar panels come in all shapes and sizes (Bewilderingly, some are even triangular). Of course,
						it is good to be able to fit as much power in a given space as possible, and so the dimensions
						of different modules should be taken into account when designing an array. Sometimes you have enough 
						space on a roof to squeeze in perhaps not another row, but the same number of panels of a slightly larger size 
						and higher power rating. This chart is to help remember some of the ones we use, since memorizing every module's
						dimensions is a bit of a stretch. That said, this is a chart of information burned into my head 
						that I use on an almost daily basis.
						
						<br><br>I imagine I'll be remembering that a SIL-370-HC is 40.8" x 69.4" for the rest of my life.
						<br><br>I have no idea why we use decimals when measuring in inches. It's an American thing.
