		<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Jack. I am a confusing amalgam of Brit and Yank who sounds like an American but speaks like a Brit. I call 
				my mother "mum", say the word "boot" to refer to the trunk of a car, and call trousers "trousers".
			</p>
			<p>
				My most cherished hobbies are skiing and cutting down trees. I live in Hawaii now, so those are sadly unavailable for now. My other interests include
				drawing, writing, hiking, motorcycle riding and the odd game of Goldeneye:Source. I used to play video games a lot, but it turns out I never played
				them nearly as much as I thought I did, so I mostly stopped. My goal is to build a cabin in the woods so that I can own a house	without going into debt.
				A laughable goal in this day and age, but I like a challenge.
			</p>
			<p>
				Though it is not at all my passion or even my interest, I work as a solar array designer. As a result I now have a keen eye for how suitable someone's roof
				is for installing solar. So if you see me in town, standing in front of random people's houses and grimacing at their roofs, you will have an idea
				of what I'm doing. Solar is not my passion, but <s>abrasively</s> constructively giving opinions on why the person who put those dormers on such a 
				beautiful south-facing roof should be ashamed of themselves <i>is</i> my passion.
