                <h2>How do I make my own pixelart?</h2>
                <p>
                    

                    Unlike many other art media, the barrier to entry for making pixelart is
                    rock-bottom. After all, you're just painting with squares!
                    All you need to get started is a paint program and a mouse.

                    <br> <br>

                    That said, getting good at making pixelart takes practice, just like any
                    other skill. The sky is the limit for how skilled you want to become. Luckily,
                    you are on the internet, which is absolutely brimming with tutorials and resources
                    of every kind to help you make your blocky visions come to life. 
                    
                </p>

                <h2>Tools</h2>

                <p>
                    You can use any paint program you want, and it doesn't have to be costly or complicated.
                    Since pixelart is the very essence of "less is more", a program that lends itself to
                    simplicity will be all the better. Here are a couple of suggestions. 
                </p>

                <h3>MS Paint</h3>
                <p>
                    The art tool of choice for every five-year-old furnished with a mouse. This is on almost every
                    computer known to man and costs nothing. It is rather barebones and isn't designed for pixelart
                    specifically, but if you want to draw and you want to do it now, now now, this can be an option.
                </p>
                <h3>Aseprite</h3>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.aseprite.org">Aseprite</a> is a great tool, made specifically
                    for the production of pixelart and pixelart animations. The two animations you 
                    see at the top of this page were made in Aseprite by myself. It is a paid 
                    product, but is source-available, so it can be obtained for free if you are 
                    willing to compile the source code yourself. A fully open source, albeit deprecated version
                    can be found in Libresprite.
                </p>

                <p>Other programs include:

                </p>
                <h3>Adobe Photoshop</h3>
                <h3>Paint.net</h3>
                <h3>Piskel</h3>
                <h3>Krita</h3>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90BghUX7SD0">This video</a> runs through some of the programs mentioned above, as well as some others.

                    Our modern world allows for the sharing of informational videos and tutorials by anyone with
                    so much as a smartphone camera. Youtube has lots and lots of videos to help you with every stage
                    of developing your skills. 
                    <br>
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUlgvNe4BLU">Here</a> is a great video by pixel artist 
                    Brandon James Greer on one potential way to get started.

                <h2>Reference Art!</h2>

                <p>
                    When starting out, you shouldn't be drawing from imagination... and you don't have to!
                    There are so many examples and styles of pixelart to choose from that you can reference for your own
                    practice. There are even websites that contain sprites and environment assets that are <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/good-cc0-art"> CC0 or Public Domain</a>
                    which you can use, modify or redistribute freely. 
                </p>

                <h2>Reject Modernity: Embrace Tradition</h2>

                <p>Remember the bit on the history page about cross-stitching? It 
                    turns out that cross-stitching is still a thing! This is a way
                    you can very easily take a piece of pixelart you like and 
                    turn it into something real! A pixel is a square, as is a cross-stitch. As long
                    as you're not changing the resolution of the image, the only
                    challenge in cross-stitching is color-matching. 
                    <br> <br>
                    A great online utility to produce cross-stitch charts from images
                    is <a href="https://www.stitchfiddle.com/en/chart/create/cross-stitch/other/convert-picture-photo-image">Stitchfiddle.</a>
