                <h2>What Is Pixelart?</h2>
                <p>
                    Pixelart is a term that refers to a type of art style where images are drawn
                    using a limited number of pixels and, often, a limited colorspace. The term "pixelart"
                    dates back to the dawn of computer graphics in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
                    Until the 1990s, almost all computer graphics were done in this style 
                    <a href="https://blog.exchange.art/pixel-art/">out of necessity</a> because
                    of technological limitations.

                    <br>
                    Though these limitations have long since been surpassed, pixelart still remains an extremely
                    popular style used in the development of many video games to this day. Even if you are fairly young,
                    odds are some of your favorite video games are pixelart games, in some form or another.
