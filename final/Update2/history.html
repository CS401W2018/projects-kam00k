                <h2>A Brief History of Pixelart</h2>
                <p>
                    Pixelart has been around since the dawn of computer graphics. It has its origins
                    in video games, and this is primarily where it has enjoyed most of its popularity
                    ever since. Since it can be argued that the pixelart and video games go hand-in-hand,
                    their histories can be drawn along similar lines.

                    We'll start at the beginning... the very beginning.

                    Ha! You thought we were starting with computer graphics, didn't you? It turns out that
                    pixelart has an ancestor: Cross-stitching!

                    Cross-stitching is known to have existed since at least the 7th century AD. 
                    It was often used in samplers
                    to teach needlework skills to young girls. The earliest surviving sampler featuring cross-stitching
                    was made by Jane Bostocke all the way back in the 1590s.

                <p>
                    Named the Bubble Era because of the video game bubble that popped towards the end of 
                    this period, the Bubble Era is when video games first began to appear in the public
                    consciousness. The graphics used in many systems had very limited color palettes,
                    from single-bit monochrome (e.g. Pong or Asteroids) to the Atari VCS, a console that

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Even though game consoles and computers prior to this era also had 8-bit data buses, 
                    this was the first time video game consoles were marketed by their "bits". The increased 
                    capabilities of microprocessors allowed Nintendo and other companies to
                    develop more and more ambitious games. The color spaces were still somewhat limited, but
                    these limits now had more to do with regional color television standards than the hardware
                    themselves. Some of the most recognizable video game franchises developed during this era,
                    such as Final Fantasy, Mario Bros., and The Legend of Zelda.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    Technology continued to advance at a rapid pace, and so did the sophistication of both games
                    and computer graphics, but they were not yet to the point where pixelart had become obsolete.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    During this period, computers developed to the point where games using 3D models, shaders and texture mapping
                    became feasible. Pixelart largely became relegated to handheld consoles, whose low
                    computational power made it still a necessity.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    With the development of various game development engines that have made game production substantially easier, 
                    pixelart has seen a renaissance in recent years. Flash games from the mid-2000s, such as those developed by <a href="https://www.nitrome.com">Nitrome</a>, were often
                    are made in this style. Indie pixelart games made by solo developers have enjoyed famous success and popularity
                    on Steam and other platforms. Now, rather than being considered low-tech or "retro", pixelart is simply another
                    stylistic choice for game development and other artistic pursuits.
