		<blockquote>Jack: That's a pretty good arugment, Senator, why don't you back it up with a source?<br><br>
					Senator Armstrong: My source is that I made it up!</blockquote>
					
		<p>Here's an quote from <em><strong>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</strong></em></p>
		<blockquote>
		Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of his longing beyond man—and the string of his bow will have unlearned to whizz!

<br><br>I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.

<br><br>Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself.

<br><br>Lo! I show you the last man.

<br><br>“What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?”—so asketh the last man and blinketh.

<br><br>The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man who maketh everything small. His species is ineradicable like that of the ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.
		</blockquote>
