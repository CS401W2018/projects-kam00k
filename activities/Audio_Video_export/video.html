			<li>Hosting videos on YouTube reduces the amount of data you need to store on your own webserver. You are also not limited by bandwidth. A potential downside of this is that it may direct attention away from your website, either through the video itself, video recommendations that appear when the video ends, or advertising.</li>
			<li>Since translate and scale already have alternatives, the most useful transform action is rotation.</li>
			<li>This question was not covered in class today, so I'll include my response from the DNS and SSL assignment: <br>
				Make sure your certificates are trustworthy, only download files and programs from trustworthy sources, and generally just don't click on anything that seems too good to be true. Common sense goes a long way here. That free iPad 2 you "won" is not real.			
			</li>
			<li>There is one more class engagement this coming Friday. For the next two weeks we will only be meeting on Monday and Wednesday. There are two assignments due during that time: Final Project Updates 1 & 2. The Final Project itself is due on December 4th, and we will have presentations on our websites in class on December 9th. </li>
