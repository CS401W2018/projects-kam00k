				<li>Block tags always make new lines. Inline tags do not. div tags are an example of block tags while span tags are an example of inline tags.</li>
				<li>Normal Flow refers to the normal, default way content is laid out in HTML files. CSS can be used to affect the relationship between a given element and the normal flow of a page.</li>
				<li>Float is a way of allowing two or more elements to share horizontal space. Elements can be floated left or 
				right and other elements such as text will navigate around them. 
				Clearing them involves invoking a clear statement in a css class. This can clear left, right or both floats at once.</li>
				<li>Absolute will position an element relative to its nearest ancestor, and will stay there regardless of window resizing. Fixed will fix an element to its position in the viewport. 
				An element fixed in the upper right hand corner will stay visible in that corner even when scrolling through the page, even if it blocks other content.
				Relative means that an element's position is relative to its default position, and can be adjusted.	</li>
				<li>Use a "display: block" statement to increase the active size of a link to its element's bounds, which can then be resized to be more easily pressed by people's fingers.</li>
