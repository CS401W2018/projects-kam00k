			there aren't many places in New Hampshire that<br>
			could count as recognizable landmarks. So I put<br>
			a picture of Tilton's Folly. It's an honorific <br>

					1. img tags should be used for images
				<br>that have to do with the content of the page. 
				<br>Background images should be used for cases
				<br>besides this. Background images also do not 
				<br>show up by default when printing a webpage.
