				<li>Flex allows for a lot of ways that webpages can auto-adjust their format for different window and display sizes. Elements can wrap by row and reorganize themselves, for instance. Elements' display order can be reversed through flex-direction.</li>
				<li>Accessibility means that a website is designed to be usable by people with disabilities. It is not only ethical to design sites this way, but it is also often a legal requirement for certain entities.</li>
