					For my topic, I intend to create a website about pixelart sprites. I picked this topic because in terms of game development, pixelart is a style that appeals to me greatly. I have dabbled in it somewhat and would like to pursue it further. Works made from it often look very sharp, and it forces asset makers to be creative with the limited number of pixels. The barrier to entry is also non-existent: A mouse and MS paint are all you need.
					<br><br>
					My pages will be as follows:
				</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Home Page: A welcome page with various colorful examples of (my) pixelart down the sides. </li>
					<li>Introductory Page: What Is Pixelart? A brief history of pixelart and how it has thrived in the art and gaming industry for so long. </li>
					<li>Resources for Making Your Own Pixelart: Includes information and references from youtube videos, articles, etc. These will be references, not copy-pastes.
					</li>
					<li>Portfolio: A grid of works that I have done</li>
					<li>Service Table: Lists the fees for commissions I would do based on various characteristics of a given work, such as size, color-depth, etc.</li>
					<li>Form: The form would be for getting in touch with potential customers concerning desired commissions.</li>
					
				</ol>
				
				<p>
					Information I will collect in my form will be things such as sprite size, color scheme, animation frames, contact information and any special circumstances or requests. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My table will list general estimates for commission fees. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There are plenty of resources online for learning about Pixelart, including tutorials on how to make your own, various styles that exist, etc. <br><br>
					Here are a couple of resources I plan to use.

				"My Character Sprite Workflow" by Brandon James Greer. This is a great overview of just one pixel artist's workflow and the methodology he uses to create sprites.<br><br>

				One of the best platforms I have used for pixelart: Aseprite. I have even used it for an animaton or two. It is paid software, but also open-source, so if the paid version is too steep you can compile it yourself if you really want. <br><br>

					I have read the warnings listed in the assignment, and I agree with them wholeheartedly. I will not copy anything from anywhere, and I certainly won't be using Muh A.I./Chatjibbity 4.0 to generate content or code for me.
