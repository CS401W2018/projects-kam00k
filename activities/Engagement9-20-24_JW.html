			<h1>Absolute Links</h1>
			<p>This is an absolute link.</p>
			<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">Watch General Conference</a>
			<p>Absolute links start with the protocol and location of a website,<br>
			as well as the its root folder. It will work from anywhere.</p>
			
			<h1>Relative Links</h1>
			
			<a href="Engagement9-13-24_JW.html">This is a relative link.</a>
			<p>Relative links are "relative" to the location of the current webpage. <br>
			This is one of the reasons they can use rules such as . and ..</p>
			
			<p>The 3 rules of relative links are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>. = Current directory (can be used, but redundant)</li>
				<li>.. = Parent directory (Above the current one)</li>
				<li>/ = Start at root directory</li>
			</ol>
			<a href="../projects/PersonalProfile.html">Link to last project</a>
			
			<p> Links do not need to be inside the nav section, but it can help keep websites consistently organized across pages.</p>
