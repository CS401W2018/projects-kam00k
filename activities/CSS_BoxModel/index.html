					Block tags always start on a new line, while inline tags do not. <br>
					Block tags will also go as far left and right as possible, while inline tags <br>
					are confined to the bounds of their parent elements.

					Padding clears a transparent area around the content. <br>
					Borders go around padding and content, are non-transparent, and can have different styles. <br>
					Margin clears an transparent area around the borders, padding and content.

					There are many units of measurement available in CSS, split into two groups: absolute and relative <br>
					Relative units are things like %, em, ch and rem, while absolute units are things like <br>
					cm, mm, in, px, pt and pc.

					<li>
					Figures are used for self-contained pieces of content that are relative to the <br> 
					main flow of content, but on which the flow of content does not depend.
